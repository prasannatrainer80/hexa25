Increment and decrement operators : 
____________________________________

++, --

int x=3;
x++

++x 

What is pre-increment (vs) post-increment

In Post-increment, at first it assigns old value and then it increments, 

In Pre-Increment at first it increments and assigns the updated value. 

Post-Increment updated value comes in picture in next operator or next statement. 

int x=3;
int y = x++ + ++x;

x=3
A   3 + 5
M   4   5

You can create an object to the class, as

class_name obj = new class_name();

Control Structures : 
______________________

	Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as

(i) Branching : 

	if...else : Executes the statement(s) based on the condition.

		if(condition) {
		    statement(s);
		} else {
		   statement(s);
		}

	switch...case : Used to define the menu-driven programs. 

	switch(expression) {
		case expression1 : 
			statement(s);
			break;	
		case expression2 : 
			statement(s);
			break;
		case expression3 : 
			statement(s);
			break;
		default : 
			statement(s);
			break;
	}

(ii) Looping 

while loop : This loop executes all the statement(s) repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization	-> Performed at the beginning of the loop

	(ii) Condition 		-> Performed at the conditional part of the loop

	(iii) Increment/Decrement -> Performed before closing the loop

while(condition) {
...
...
...
}
