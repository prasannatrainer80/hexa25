How the way git is going to work

First the directory we are currently doing coding known as Working Directory

From Working Directory, we need to send the code to staging area 

1) Staging Area : This is the area, where all the files/data finalized is ready to commit and to be shared. 

2) Local Repository : It is a repo which exists in your local system, and here we can commit the changes. 

3) Remote Repository : Once you send the files to remote repository, then who are authorized can access, if the repo is public every one can access by default. 

From the working directory, at first i need to add to staging area. 

git add . -> This command allows you to add all modified files to the staging area 

git commit -m "message" -> This command allows you to add the files to the local repository. 

git push origin <branch_name>

git push origin main  -> This command allows you to add all the files to the main branch 

git status : Used to see the status of the git work flow 

git diff : Used to identify the difference between old commit (vs) uncommited data 

git checkout filename : Used to cancel the changes of the file 

Sometimes, we need to unstage the files which we added by mistake to staging area,

for that we need to do

git reset HEAD "filename" : Used to unstage the given files. 

Steps : 

create a file using notepad as "hi.txt" and write some content into that.

add the file to staging area as

git add .

To unstage the file, then 

git reset HEAD hi.txt 

To create a branch, we need to give the command as 

git branch branch_name 

To change to the branch 

git checkout branch_name

To create a branch and change into that automatically, 

git checkout -b branch_name 

To see the list of branches 

git branch 

To update all the branches of repository

git remote update

To delete a branch

git branch -d branch_name

git branch -d b1

git branch -d b2 

git pull origin branch_name : To get the changes from the corresponding branch, then
git pull origin b1 

then from b1 to current branch what are the coding changes are there are gets reflected
